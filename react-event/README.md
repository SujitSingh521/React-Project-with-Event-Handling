React Event Handling Example :-
This project demonstrates basic event handling in React, showcasing both event handling without and with arguments. It includes examples of using standard event handlers as well as passing custom arguments to event handler functions.

Project Overview
In this project, there are two buttons with different types of event handling:

Button without Argument: When clicked, it triggers the handleClick1 function, which simply logs a message to the console indicating the button was clicked.
Button with Argument: When clicked, it triggers the handleClick2 function with a custom argument ("Hi There"), logging that argument alongside a message to the console.
The event handling functions showcase how to prevent the default behavior (in the case of handleClick1) and how to pass custom arguments to event handler functions (in the case of handleClick2).
